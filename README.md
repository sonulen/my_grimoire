## The Posts Folder
The _posts folder is where your blog posts live. You typically write posts in Markdown, HTML is also supported.

### Creating Posts
To create a post, add a file to your _posts directory with the following format: **YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP**  
Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file.   
For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```bash
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

All blog post files must begin with front matter which is typically used to set a layout or other meta data.
